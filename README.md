Python Workshop
===============

Installation Notes
------------------
This tutorial will require recent installations of *ipython* with ipython notebook.
The last one is important: you should be able to type

    ipython notebook

in your terminal window and see the notebook panel load in your web browser.

For users who do not yet have these  packages installed, a relatively
painless way to install all the requirements is to use a package such as
[Anaconda CE](http://store.continuum.io/ "Anaconda CE"), which can be
downloaded and installed for free.

Downloading the Tutorial Materials
----------------------------------
I would highly recommend using git, not only for this tutorial, but for the
general betterment of your life.  Once git is installed, you can clone the
material in this tutorial by using the git address shown above:

    git clone https://github.com/abinashpanda/python_workshop.git

If you can't or don't want to install git, there is a link above to download
the contents of this repository as a zip file.
